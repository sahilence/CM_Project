Project for CSE585 offering in Monsoon 2024

****Motivation and Problem statement****

Reports show a significant lack of food awareness in India, leading to health issues like
obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Rapid urbanization and changing diets, especially
among the urban middle class, have increased consumption of ultra-processed, caloriedense foods, driving a rise in chronic conditions.
**Key Findings:**
56% of India's disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets (ICMR).
Nutritional deficiencies caused 0.5% of deaths in 2016.
India has the world's highest burden of anaemia (NFHS-4).
Zinc deficiency affects 19% of preschoolers and 32% of adolescents (CNNSC, 2019).
Vitamin B12, A, and D deficiencies range from 14â€“31% in children and teens.

****Solution Statement****

Enhancing nutritional awareness and promoting healthier dietary
habits among Indians through
DishCovery.
**Two main features:**

Scan nutritional labels from packaged food to get a personalized
evaluation of that product.
Track the daily food you eat to get an analysis of your dietary
patterns
